# Video Game Recommender

## 🔍 Overview

A project to generate recommendations from a given game, based on a user's
playtime profile compared to other users.

## 📊 Problem Statement

Game recommendations are typically done at the *game level*; that is, they
look for similarities between games to provide a potential next fit. Some
questions to answer:

1. What is the standard way to recommend video games? (Amazon, Gamestop, etc.)
2. How does Steam recommend games? Is it better than the industry standard?
3. How effective is user playtime at predicting another game they may like?
4. How do other game attributes affect user playtime? (genres, tags, etc.)
