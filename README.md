# Matt's Data Science Porftolio

Welcome! This repository houses a collection of my data science and machine
learning projects, built to showcase problem solving, technical development,
and communication skills.

I'm taking my 7 years of data analytics experience to transition into a
data-science-focused role, and this portfolio is mean to capture/document my
curiousity and learning journey.
